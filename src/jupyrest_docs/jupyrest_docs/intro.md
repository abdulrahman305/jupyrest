# Welcome to Jupyrest

Jupyrest is a library that turns Jupyter notebooks into REST APIs.

Jupyrest lets you:

* Users can define input and output schemas for any notebook
* Parameterize and execute notebooks using an HTTP client

Use cases:

* Making analysis written in a Jupyter notebook available to team members via an API.
* Automate incident response by invoking a Jupyter notebook whenever an incident or other alert is raised.
* Easily deploy data science/machine learning workflows written in Jupyter notebooks.
* Develop a POC (proof of concept) web application without the need for any frontend development or telemetry infrastructure.
